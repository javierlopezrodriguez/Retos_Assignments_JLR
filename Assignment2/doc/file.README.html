<p>This code uses the gem rgl, version 0.5.7, to work with graphs in ruby (<a
href="https://github.com/monora/rgl">github.com/monora/rgl</a>) I have
installed it using: sudo gem install rgl</p>

<p>Command to run the code:</p>

<p>ruby main.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt Report1.txt</p>

<p>Command to run the tests:</p>

<p>ruby AnnotationTest.rb</p>

<p>ruby InteractionNetworkTest.rb</p>
<hr>

<p>I&#39;ve obtained three reports, finding interactions in the IntAct
database and using different filters for the quality of the interactions.</p>

<p>Unfiltered-Report1.txt contains the unfiltered interactions. I&#39;ve
obtained 4 networks, which include 44 out of the 168 genes from
ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt</p>

<p>Medium-quality-Report1.txt contains the medium and high quality
interactions (with a miscore &gt;= 0.45). I&#39;ve obtained 2 networks,
which include 11 out of the 168 genes.</p>

<p>High-quality-Report1.txt contains the high quality interactions (with a
miscore &gt;= 0.6). I&#39;ve only obtained 1 network, which includes only a
direct interaction between 2 of the 168 genes.</p>

<p>I have only considered direct interactions (A &lt;–&gt; B, both of them in
the gene list) and indirect interactions with one degree of separation (A
&lt;–&gt; X, X &lt;–&gt; B, where A and B are in the gene list, and X is
not).</p>

<p>Using filtering restricts the amount of interactions that are found.
However, even when not filtering, only 44 out of the 168 genes are shown to
have protein-protein interactions with other members of the gene list. I
think that some members of the gene list form protein-protein interaction
networks, but not all of them.</p>
