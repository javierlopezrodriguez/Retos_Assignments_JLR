Assignment 5 SPARQL queries


I would like you to create the SPARQL query that will answer each of these questions.  Please submit the queries simply as a text document (NO programming is required!) - submit to GitHub as usual.  


For many of these you will need to look-up how to use the SPARQL functions ‘COUNT’ and ‘DISTINCT’ (we used ‘distinct’ in class), and probably a few others...

UniProt SPARQL Endpoint:  http://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql


Q1: 1 POINT  How many protein records are in UniProt? 




Q2: 1 POINT How many Arabidopsis thaliana protein records are in UniProt? 




Q3: 1 POINT retrieve pictures of Arabidopsis thaliana from UniProt? 




Q4: 1 POINT:  What is the description of the enzyme activity of UniProt Protein Q9SZZ8 




Q5: 1 POINT:  Retrieve the proteins ids, and date of submission, for proteins that have been added to UniProt this year   (HINT Google for “SPARQL FILTER by date”)




Q6: 1 POINT How  many species are in the UniProt taxonomy?




Q7: 2 POINT  How many species have at least one protein record? (this might take a long time to execute, so do this one last!)


Q8: 3 points:  find the AGI codes and gene names for all Arabidopsis thaliana  proteins that have a protein function annotation description that mentions “pattern formation”






From the MetaNetX metabolic networks for metagenomics database SPARQL Endpoint: https://rdf.metanetx.org/sparql




Q9: 4 POINTS:  what is the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (starts with “mnxr”) for the UniProt Protein uniprotkb:Q18A79




FEDERATED QUERY - UniProt and MetaNetX


Q10: 5 POINTS:  What is the official Gene ID (UniProt calls this a “mnemonic”) and the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (mnxr…..) for the protein that has “Starch synthase” catalytic activity in Clostridium difficile (taxon 272563).
