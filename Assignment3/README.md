Command to run the program:

ruby main.rb

Files:

assignment3_functions.rb contains the functions I made for this assignment. I haven't created any custom objects, I think the ones provided by BioRuby are enough.

main.rb contains the main program.

AT2G46340_full_219022154_19027528.pdf contains the screenshot of the AT2G46340 gene with the feature track added.

AT2G46340_zoomed_219027246_19027307.pdf contains the screenshot of a zoomed region where there are overlapping CTTCTT so that it can be seen more easily.

Test3.ipynb was a notebook for me to test things about BioRuby, it doesn't contain anything relevant for the assignment.

I haven't made proper tests for this assignment but I have checked on the ensembl visualizer some of the genes and I'm confident it works correctly.
